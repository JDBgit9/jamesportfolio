# James Justis Portfolio

## Description
This digital portfolio was created with React.js with elements requiring HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, and more. This site displays not only my ability as a coder, but my creativity and dedication to the skills that I have acquired over the years. This is an ongoing project that I am sure will  evolve in time as I do have a great time developing it and seeing the different forms it can take in order for it to truly represent what I have to offer as a developer.  This started out as responsive portfolio with just the basics and as I have grown as a developer I have truly grown to appreciate the hard work that goes into this profession. I  added an artwork section to display my hand drawn sketches of ideas that I somehow would like to transform into the virtual/digital realm.

## Credits
I created this project solely, but I'd like to thank my Alma Mater University of Central Florida, my teachers and assistants who tutored me along the way. JT, JP, my bootcamp classmates at UCF, Udemy, Free Code Camp, Josh Corenel, Wyzant, the MemeBate team, my family, my friends, my coworkers, mu dogs, and especially my cat Neville, he's the cutest most smartest cat in the whole wide world. He is all black with beautiful green eyes and he follows me everywhere I go.  When I am coding he keepsme company and lets me pet his soft mane. I love that cat.

## Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
This project is pretty straight forward. If you like it and have a job for me then that is what this project is all about. Thank you I look forward to being a great asset to the company and the culture of the industry. If you don't like it and don't have a job for me then I really don't care.
